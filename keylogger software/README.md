- **Disable Keylogging When Not Needed** – Provide an easy way to pause or stop logging.
- **Secure Network Communications** – If transmitting logs, use HTTPS or secure protocols.

### ⚠️ Legal & Ethical Considerations
- **Comply with Privacy Laws** – Follow GDPR, CCPA, or local regulations.
- **Avoid Unauthorized Monitoring** – Ensure your software is used ethically.
- **Inform Users Clearly** – No hidden data collection or unauthorized surveillance.
