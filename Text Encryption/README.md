## ❓ FAQ

### 🔹 How does the text encryption tool work?
This tool encrypts and decrypts messages using **AES, DES, and RSA** encryption algorithms. It provides real-time feedback and ensures secure encryption.

### 🔹 What encryption algorithms are supported?
The tool supports **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**, **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**, and **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)**.

### 🔹 Do I need a key for encryption?
- **AES & DES** require a key (recommended **at least 8 characters**).
- **RSA** does not require a user-entered key since it uses **public/private key encryption**.

### 🔹 Is my data stored anywhere?
No, the encryption and decryption happen **locally** within your device. The tool does not store or send any sensitive data.

### 🔹 How can I improve password security?
- Use **longer passwords** (at least 12–16 characters).
- Include **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.
- Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.
- Avoid using **common or easily guessable passwords**.

### 🔹 Can I use this tool offline?
Yes! Since it's built with **Python Tkinter**, you can run it locally without an internet connection.

### 🔹 How do I change the tool's language?
The tool supports **English and Hindi**. You can select your preferred language from the dropdown menu in the UI.

## 📚 Appendix

### 🔹 Supported Encryption Algorithms
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** – Symmetric encryption for secure data.
- **DES (Data Encryption Standard)** – Older encryption method, now less secure.
- **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)** – Asymmetric encryption using public/private key pairs.

### 🔹 Useful Security Resources
- [OWASP Password Security Guidelines](https://owasp.org/www-project-password-cheat-sheet/)
- [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) – Check for compromised passwords.
- [Cryptography in Python](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/) – Official documentation for encryption libraries.

### 🔹 Additional Notes
- Ensure encryption keys are **strong and unique** to prevent brute-force attacks.
- Use **multi-factor authentication** wherever possible for added security.
- Encryption strength may vary based on **key length and complexity**.

## 🛠 Installation
