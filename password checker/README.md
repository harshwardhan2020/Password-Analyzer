## ❓ FAQ

### 🔹 How does the password strength checker work?
The tool evaluates password strength based on its length, complexity, and character diversity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols). A progress bar visually indicates security levels.

### 🔹 How is the estimated crack time calculated?
It uses an estimated number of guesses per second that an attacker could make to brute-force a password. The longer and more complex your password, the more time it would take to crack.

### 🔹 What is the recommended password length?
Security experts recommend using passwords with at least **12-16 characters**, including a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.

### 🔹 Can I use this tool offline?
Yes! Since it's built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, you can run it directly in a browser without an internet connection.

### 🔹 Is this password checker storing my passwords?
No, your password is **not stored or sent anywhere**. The analysis happens locally in your browser.

### 🔹 How can I improve password security?
Try using a **passphrase**, enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**, and use a **password manager** for secure storage.
